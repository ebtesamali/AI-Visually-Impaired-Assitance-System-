# AI Visually Impaired Assitance System
AI system for helping visually impaired fully support Arabica language

in this project, we  used computer vision and voice recognition techniques to guide visually impaired users to find the objects they need during their daily routines via object detection and recognition. Vocal user commands and responses are also generated vocally in Arabic. 
the proposed method consists of 3 modules: 
-<b>object detection
-<b>speech-to-text
-<b>and text-to-speech.
